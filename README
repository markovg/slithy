Welcome to the NE.O Slithy hg repo!





To build:

make sure you have the required software installed.

On an ubuntu jaunty or karmic system, I required the following packages:

$ sudo apt-get install tk8.5-dev  libfreetype6-dev mesa-common-dev python-opengl libglu1-mesa-dev python-pmw python-pygame python-yaml python-dev libglew1.5-dev

Then go into the source directory

$ cd slithy

Have a look at the Makefile and make sure everything is ok.
The Tk version, is 8.4 on <jaunty systems.  8.5 for jaunty, karmic

$ make

$ cd ..

$ sudo python setup.py install
