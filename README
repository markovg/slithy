Welcome to the NE.O Slithy hg repo!





To build:

make sure you have the required software installed.

On an ubuntu jaunty or karmic system, I required the following packages:

$ sudo apt-get install tk8.5-dev  libfreetype6-dev mesa-common-dev python-opengl libglu1-mesa-dev python-pmw python-pygame python-yaml python-dev libglew1.5-dev inkscape

To use reStructuredText (rst) content in slides, you need to install
rst2pdf>=0.12.3.  This version is available as of ubuntu 10.04 lucid.
Also, for vector image support, install uniconverter (http://sk1project.org)
version 1.1.3 or later.

$ sudo apt-get install rst2pdf python-uniconverter

rst2pdf is also available in jaunty and karmic, but with
version<0.12.3 ... I guess there will be problems.  My presentation
laptop I use slithy with has jaunty installed, and I have installed
rst2pdf 0.12.3 from source there.

For use of reStructuredText in slides, see: examples/rst_content_example


Then go into the source directory

$ cd slithy

Have a look at the Makefile and make sure everything is ok.
The Tk version, is 8.4 on <jaunty systems.  8.5 for jaunty, karmic

$ make

$ cd ..

$ sudo python setup.py install

Try out some of the presentations in examples
